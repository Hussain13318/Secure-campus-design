# Secure-campus-design
This project is a C++ campus access management system that handles role-based permissions for students, faculty, and admins. Users can log in and request access to restricted zones, while all activities are recorded for monitoring.

The system allows admins to manually grant access to users and view detailed logs of all access attempts. This ensures secure management of sensitive areas like the Digital Library, Cyber Lab, and Data Center.

The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, templates, and operator overloading. It also uses STL vectors to manage dynamic user and log data efficiently.

Features include: role-based login, zone access control, activity logging, and admin functions such as granting access and viewing logs.
